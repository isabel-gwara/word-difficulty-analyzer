Have you ever lost sleep because of a video game? Had trouble paying attention in school because you were thinking about browsing TikTok or Instagram? Spent so much time watching YouTube video after YouTube video that you forgot you were a real person? These experiences are fairly common. In 2014, researchers estimated that about six percent of people worldwide had an "internet addiction". This experience is often called digital addiction, which means a harmful dependence on digital media and devices that interferes with daily activities like school, work, and sleep. But the rise in digital addiction is no accident. It's a feature, not a bug. Tech and video game companies like Meta and Blizzard know their products can lead to addictive behaviors. In many cases, they actively design addictive features into their products with the goal of increasing their revenue. As part of their strategy, these companies use artificial intelligence to learn users' habits and keep them coming back for more. Artificial intelligence (AI) surrounds us â€“ from Alexa to TikTok to Google Maps. It's defined as a man-made system that exercises problem-solving or decision-making abilities normally associated with humans. Essentially, an AI is a computer-based system that has learned a specific skill over time. AI learns from data collected from the real world. For example, an AI that recommends you your next TikTok video can guess what you would like best because it's seen what thousands of other people have watched.
In this document set, you will examine the role of AI in digital addiction. You'll see tons of examples of digital addiction in the real world, examine how digital addiction is purposely designed, and explore ways AI can help prevent digital addiction as well.
