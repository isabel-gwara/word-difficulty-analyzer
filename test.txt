	Apps aren’t addicting because of AI. They’re addicting because of so many other factors, and AI happens to be a small part of that. Here are five other reasons why people use phone apps like social media so much:
We love our phones. Platforms like TikTok are popular because we have a device in our pocket that we rely on for information, entertainment, and social connection.
We crave social connection. Social media brings people closer together. It allows people to grow closer to one another, centering around friends and family.
We like feeling happy. Using phone apps like Instagram releases dopamine, a chemical that causes motivation and happiness.
We get bored. Boredom has been on the rise lately among teenagers, especially for girls. Some researchers think it’s related to an increase in mental health concerns among teens, but others think it’s because of less time spent with friends.
We care about our wellbeing. While people spend a lot of time on mobile apps, a lot of those apps aren’t social media. Some of the fastest-growing app categories in 2021 were health, fitness, and mental wellbeing.
